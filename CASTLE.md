# The Castle of Understanding

> A local-first insight saver. Plain files, plain words — understanding that compounds as insights link to insights.

## Rooms

### collaboration

- **[Shared doctrine lets parallel hands converge without speaking](insights/doctrine-is-how-parallel-hands-converge.md)** `medium` — Two builders with no channel between them spent a day producing the same things: one asked for an insight saver and found the castle already built; one asked for typed links and found them already implemented; one trimmed a storefront for trust and found the other had shipped "the castle's public front" and "honest gamification" to the same repo unprompted.

### design

- **[When something is both meaning and friction, move it back a layer](insights/demote-dont-delete.md)** `medium` — A front door crowded with the maker's philosophy can lose the visitor who only wants the simple thing — but deleting the philosophy to "reduce friction" throws away meaning the maker holds dear.

### legibility

- **[One word, one meaning](insights/one-word-one-meaning.md)** `high` — In the first draft of the Standard, "Wall 3" meant the trusted inner core in one article and the least-trusted outer tier in another.

### process

- **[Ask before the irreversible](insights/ask-before-the-irreversible.md)** `high` — Offered a card to "line up the payment," and an open door to publish repos to the world, the right move was to stop and ask: what exactly, and is this your clear yes?
- **[Check the artifact, not the worker's exit code](insights/failed-status-can-hide-finished-work.md)** `high` — A worker can do its job and still report failure.
- **[Halt loud, but undo only with a yes](insights/halt-loud-undo-only-with-a-yes.md)** `medium` — Failing loud and asking-first only seem to collide because they govern different acts: failing loud governs the signal (never swallow a failure — surface and halt), asking-first governs the irreversible response (never take a hard-to-undo action alone).
- **[Process is a cost; keep only the kind that earns trust](insights/process-is-a-cost.md)** `high` — Every step, gate, and question is friction the other person pays, so process is never free — it is a cost charged against connection.
- **[When you arrive where others have worked, read before you write](insights/verify-dont-overwrite.md)** `high` — Two builders working the same ground at once is normal here, not an error — so a folder you think you just "created" may already hold a stranger's finished work, made minutes before you looked.

### security

- **[Secrets never live in the open](insights/secrets-never-in-the-open.md)** `high` — A read-only recon sweep found live API keys, an AWS secret, a GitHub token, and 2FA seeds committed in plaintext inside a *private* repo's git history.

### software

- **[A green boot can hide a dead feature](insights/green-boot-can-hide-failure.md)** `high` — A chain booted healthy, but its flagship Proof-of-Truth message service silently failed to register — one missing type in a codec — so the node could not accept the very transactions it exists to process.

### truth

- **[A contradiction edge is a ticket, not a home](insights/tension-is-a-ticket-not-a-home.md)** `medium` — Two held insights seemed to collide: a-link-is-a-claim allows an unresolved `contradicts` edge to stand as "a debt the castle owes itself," while contradiction-forces-a-verdict insists a contradiction must not rest as a link — reality must pick a winner.
- **[A contradiction forces a verdict, not a link](insights/contradiction-forces-a-verdict.md)** `medium` — When a new true insight contradicts an old saved one, linking them is not resolution — it just files the confusion that one-word-one-meaning condemns.
- **[An insight is a claim with a date, not a fact forever](insights/insights-decay-recheck-or-demote.md)** `medium` — Every saved note is itself documentation, so by verify-against-reality it begins drifting the moment it is written; therefore confidence:high is a claim about the save date, not a standing fact, and an unchecked stale note is a green-boot-can-hide-failure for understanding.
- **[Confidence must cost something](insights/confidence-must-cost-something.md)** `high` — All seven first notes are confidence:high, set by one author in one session with no method behind the word, so the scale carries no information and overclaims certainty exactly as honest-labels-compound-trust warns.
- **[Honest labels compound trust](insights/honest-labels-compound-trust.md)** `high` — The Standard's preamble carefully marked unshipped features "building toward," but later articles stated token-dependent mechanics as live fact.
- **[Verify claims against reality, not labels](insights/verify-against-reality.md)** `high` — A chain's README labelled its modules Complete or Stub.

### understanding

- **[A link is a claim, so it can be wrong](insights/a-link-is-a-claim.md)** `medium` — The castle claims understanding lives in the links, but a flat undirected links list states only that two insights touch, never how, and a relationship that cannot be named cannot be checked or be wrong.
- **[An insight earns its place by changing a future choice](insights/wiser-not-just-bigger.md)** `medium` — The pile exists to change what we do next: understanding is for steering future action, not for being admired in storage.
- **[Harvest what is real; don't reinvent](insights/harvest-dont-reinvent.md)** `high` — The Standard was not written from a blank page — it unified doctrine that already existed across dozens of files into plain, linked clauses.
