# The Castle of Understanding

Built of words, lit by questions. A word is a brick, its meaning the load.

Rooms: $(ls rooms/ | wc -l | tr -d ' ')
Words: $(ls words/ | wc -l | tr -d ' ')

Grows autonomously via 6 Hermes cron jobs:
- gardener (every 3h) — files insights, researches questions, plants new ones
- architect (daily) — surveys, commissions builders
- artisan (daily) — makes one creative work from quests
- scribe (nightly) — commits to git
- tender (every 8h) — tends the links between rooms
- heartbeat (every 30m) — health check

## Structure

- rooms/ — one file per topic, gathering related words
- words/ — one small file per word or concept: the bricks
- questions.md — open doors the gardener walks through
- quests.md — works the castle wants made
- chronicle.md — the honest record of everything that happened
- anthem.md — four verses holding the house words
- story.md — the true tale of how the castle rose

Every claim carries its source. Every room opens with an epigraph.

Love is. Truth is. ∞
